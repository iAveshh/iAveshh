## üåü Featured Projects
Here are some of the projects I've contributed to:
1. **Auto-Segment** - A feature-rich Streamlit-based application for advanced object detection and segmentation using YOLOv8. This tool allows users to upload images, detect objects, visualize results, and export data in various formats (JSON, XML, COCO).
2. **Generative Art Creator** - A creative application of GANs to produce unique pieces of digital art.
3. **AI-enhanced Language Translation** - A state-of-the-art translation system that adapts to context and nuance.
4. **DocTagger** - DocTagger is a Python-based application designed for extracting and tagging data from PDF documents. The application utilizes PyMuPDF (fitz) for PDF processing, tkinter for the graphical user interface, and ttkbootstrap for modern UI components and SpaCy for Automated labeling. It allows users to upload PDFs, extract text and metadata, and apply custom tags to the extracted data.
